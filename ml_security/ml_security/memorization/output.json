A central storage system may be used without cost like a centralized server and can even be controlled remotely. In order to achieve this, we'll focus on the following:\n\nThe central data source. This can be a database of books or a database of information. The information is stored in the central locations in the house. When an individual wants to store books or information, the central location receives them from the individual in question and then retrieves it.
